## Welcome to Andrea Bocchimpani projects site

In this page you cand find some info about our work-group latest project!

### Protocol Project

Our task is to build a web application that will have to manage and show a company's protocols. 

We divided the projects in two side:
- Back-End
- Front-End


### Back-End Side

We start creating a class Mail

```
public class Mail
    {
        [Key]
        public string ProtId { get; set; }
        public string StartDate { get; set; }
        public string ReceiveDate { get; set; }
        public Tipo Type { get; set; }
        public string Sender { get; set; }
        public string Subject { get; set; }
        public string Object { get; set; }
        public string Attachment { get; set; }
    }
```

Our class Mail have ProtId prop as primary key and we create an Enum called Type in order to have different type of Mail

```
public enum Tipo{
        Entrata = 1,
        Uscita = 2,
        Interna = 3
    }
```
